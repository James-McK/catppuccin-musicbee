## About

A WIP (Although now mostly usable) [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) theme for [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/).

Originally based on [this](https://github.com/dracula/musicbee) Dracula MusicBee theme, which is based on the [MaterialMix](https://getmusicbee.com/addons/skins/203/materialmix-hidpi-supported/) theme.

## Usage

1. Download the `.xmlc` file for the palette and accent colour you want from [the releases](https://github.com/James-McK/Catppuccin-MusicBee/releases/tag/v2.3.0)
2. In MusicBee, using the menu in the top-left go to Select Skin >> Add Skin
3. Browse and select the downloaded `catppuccin-palette.xmlc` file
4. MusicBee should restart with the selected theme applied

Note that might be useful to somebody else: MusicBee can also be run on Linux using Wine! I have it working in a 32-bit wineprefix with dotnet48, gdiplus and xmllite. To play M4A files, you'll need to put a copy of bass_aac.dll from [here](https://www.un4seen.com/download.php?z/2/bass_aac24) in the folder alongside MusicBee.exe. This doesn't work perfectly, eg crashes on file converters page in preferences, but works well enough for me.

## Development

Currently only working on this whenever I have time for it, so progress has been fairly sporadic
### Things to do

-   [x] Basic theme
-   [x] Find all the still unthemed bits
-   [x] Theme for each palette
-   [x] Themes for different colours in each palette
-   [x] Version without accented main bar
-   [ ] Bring icons into theme - still in progress, should be mostly done
-   [ ] Any other general improvements
