## About

A still very WIP (Although now mostly usable) [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) theme for [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/).

Originally based on [this](https://github.com/dracula/musicbee) Dracula MusicBee theme, which is based on the [MaterialMix](https://getmusicbee.com/addons/skins/203/materialmix-hidpi-supported/) theme.

## Usage

1. Download the [catppuccin.xmlc](https://github.com/James-McK/Catppuccin-MusicBee/releases/download/v1.0.0/catppuccin.xmlc) file
2. In MusicBee, using the menu in the top-left go to Select Skin >> Add Skin
3. Browse and select the downloaded catppuccin.xmlc file
4. MusicBee should restart with the selected theme applied

## Development

Currently only working on this whenever I feel like it, so progress has been very slow.

The theme is currently very flat - this is an issue I'm aware of and plan to get around to (hopefully soon)

It's also possible the base colours are slightly too bright and should be shifted down by 1 - if you have any suggestions on either, let me know!

### Things to do

-   [x] Basic theme
-   [x] Create a themed icon
-   [ ] Clean up the XML (In progress)
-   [ ] Bring icons into theme palette (This may be too much work for me to ever do)
-   [ ] Themes for different colours in each pallette
-   [ ] Any other general improvements
